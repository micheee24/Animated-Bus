# Real time Bus Tracker

### The current files are not running as expected. I believe I have most of the code correct but 
just have issues with putting the marker as it updates. 

### All the code is set in order to execute this prokect you will get a copy of my code 
load it into a web browser and then it should give you the real time
location to the bus

### The future of this project will be to get it up and running to standard. I Have issues 
on what I previously stated but the final steps are just 
missing.
